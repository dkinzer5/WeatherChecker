# Weather Checker
Simple website to check the weather, using the DarkSky API. Used es6 FETCH to acquire data.

## Notes on SASS
I'm experimenting with sass file structures and most likely will be changing it throughout development.

## Workflow Notes (Gulp)
There is a pretty nice gulp workflow I set up for this project so feel free to use it! It does not have source maps or anything fancy because this project is pretty simple. You can easily add it however. My workflow will compile sass in real time, minify all images, javascript(es6 compatible), and css, then render on a live browser through local host! Check out the gulpfile to see it!
